## How to run:
make a plr_inbox folder on user on mac then just go to the eyessef_modified, in my case it's:

```bash
cd "/Users/ptrckhanzel/Documents/SSEF Related/eyeSSEF_modified"
python watch_inbox.py \
  --inbox "/Users/ptrckhanzel/plr_inbox" \
  --repo "/Users/ptrckhanzel/Documents/SSEF Related/eyeSSEF_modified"
  ```

whenever there's a video let's say from the Pi to the plr_inbox it will automatically process the thing
